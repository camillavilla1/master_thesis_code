# Peer Observation of Observation Units

## Approach and purpose

This project will develop an approach to :
* Let observation units observe data observed by observation units. 
* To gradually accumulate the data to observation units being a DAO Store (there can be multiple DAO Stores depending on user needs).
* Do a prototype of such a system focused on three levels of observation units: (i) In-situ observation units being (ii) observed by back-end observation units, being (iii) observed by a DAO Store observation unit.

The purpose is to fetch and accumulate data observed by observation units for further use.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
